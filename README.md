# Formalizing Baby Rudin

## Plan

- Use cursor to formalize my visual proofs
- Use trace to formalize my visual proofs
- my proofs:
- https://www.evernote.com/client/web#/notebook/0a437f8a-1e0f-4757-b1f1-b61a2e86e51f/note/7923fb30-4343-4f9d-a83c-10fd311439a1

### Some proofs

- Proof of limit seq def is equivalent to limit def https://www.evernote.com/client/web#/notebook/0a437f8a-1e0f-4757-b1f1-b61a2e86e51f/note/8dddfbf7-1a7e-459b-a2d4-7215867d15f6 
- If diam of a series of intervaled compact sets goes to zero then it has 1 single point https://share.evernote.com/note/6eee7f55-4540-485c-a242-5cd76d1dfc7a
- K compact <=> limit point compact
  - K compact <=> limit point compact Will session - Compact => Closed https://share.evernote.com/note/0190b920-a41e-4823-b56a-13ea9ae7940d
- Archimedean Property (the real number do not have a largest elements) https://share.evernote.com/note/7923fb30-4343-4f9d-a83c-10fd311439a1
- The complement of a set is Closed iff the original set is Open https://share.evernote.com/note/d5537da0-5988-4969-bbe5-902bc485e419

  - maybe for this we can do pictures --> formalization of an object definition rather than proofs since formalizing definitions is really importnat!
